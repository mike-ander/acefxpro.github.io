Legal Basis for Processing: When we process your personal data, we will only do so in the following situations:
</p><p>
Entering into and Performing the Contract with You: If you have an AceFxPro account or have registered on the Site or for the Services, our legal basis for processing your personal information is that it is necessary for the performance of the relevant AceFxPro’s terms and conditions and to provide a service to you. With respect to an AceFxPro account, this includes facilitating access to our platform, processing payments and executing trades.
</p><p>
For other Justifiable Grounds, including Legal Obligation and Legitimate Interests: We process your personal information where necessary for AceFxPro to comply with legal and regulatory obligations we are under, and also where it is necessary for legitimate interests we have in conducting our business. These include without limitation:
</p><p>
    <ul><li>
Learning about your interests and preferences to contact you with information that is relevant to you and helping us target marketing communication and advertisements for our products and services so that they are more relevant to you.

</li><li>Using your pseudonymised details to show you advertising for our products and services on social media platforms, such as Facebook or via other third-party advertising that may appear on other websites you use. The information shared with these platforms is pseudonymised to protect your personal data.


</li><li>Analyzing and continually improving the Site and our services and helping us pilot test versions of the Site internally to develop new features and ensure the efficient running of AceFxPro’s services.

</li><li>Detecting and reducing fraud and credit risk.
</li></ul>
</p><p>

Data Subject Requests: You have the right to access personal data we hold about you and to ask that your personal data be updated, corrected, erased, or transferred. You may also have the right to object to, or request that we restrict, certain processing. If you would like to exercise any of these rights, you can log into your account or email us at privacy@acefxpro.com. If you wish to delete or deactivate your account, please note that we may retain certain information as required by law or for legitimate business purposes. We may also retain cached or archived copies of information about you for a certain period of time.
</p><p>
Questions or Complaints: If you would like to exercise any of these rights, you can log into your account or contact us. If you have a concern about our processing of personal data that we are not able to resolve, you may have the right to lodge a complaint with the relevant authority where you reside.
</p><p><strong>
Promotional Communications</strong>
</p><p>
You may opt out of receiving promotional emails or text messages from AceFxPro by following the instructions in those emails or text. If you opt out, we may still send you non-promotional emails, such as those about your account or our ongoing business relations.
</p><p><strong>
Mobile Push Notifications/Alerts</strong>
</p><p>
With your consent, we may send promotional and non-promotional push notifications or alerts to your mobile device. You can deactivate these messages at any time by changing the notification settings on your mobile device.
</p><p><strong>
Automated Analysis of Your Personal Information</strong>
</p><p>
We use the personal information you provide to us, or that we gather when you use our services, to tailor AceFxPro to your Profile and to assign you a risk score. AceFxPro will carry out this analysis automatically, and in most cases without human intervention; the risk score does not have a legal or similarly significant effect for you. If you have any questions about the automated analysis of your personal information, please contact us (see “Contact Us” page). 
</p><p><strong>
Transfer of Information to Other Countries</strong>
</p><p>
When using our services, your data is processed and stored in the EU and other countries. We and our service providers may transfer your information to, or store or access it in, jurisdictions that may not provide equivalent levels of data protection as your home jurisdiction. We will take steps to ensure that your personal data receives an adequate level of protection in the jurisdictions in which we process it.
</p><p>
We provide adequate protection for the transfer of personal data to countries outside of the EEA not recognized as providing adequate data protection through a series of intercompany agreements based on the Standard Contractual Clauses authorized under EU law. If you would like further information, you can contact us using the contact information below.
</p><p>
<strong>
Retention of Personal Information</strong>
</p><p>
We store the information we collect on you for as long as is necessary for the purpose(s) for which we originally collected it, or for other legitimate business purposes, including to meet our legal, regulatory, or other compliance obligations. The period for which we will retain personal information will vary depending on the purposes that it was collected for, as well as the requirements of any applicable law or regulations.
</p><p>
<strong>
Security and Integrity of Information</strong>
</p><p>
We protect your personal information by using data security technology and using tools such as firewalls and data encryption. We also require that you use a personal username and password every time you access your account online. As set out in the AceFxPro’s terms and conditions, you must not share your password with anyone else. We restrict access to personal information at our offices so that only officers and/or employees with a legitimate business purpose can access it.
</p><p><strong>
Minors</strong>
</p><p>
AceFxPro is not available for users under the age of 18 (or the age of legal consent for the jurisdiction the user is located in) (a “Minor”). We do not knowingly collect personal information from or about Minors. If you are a Minor, you should not download or use any of our services nor provide any personal information to us.
</p><p>
If we become aware that a Minor has shared any information with us, we will delete such information. If you have any reason to believe that a minor has shared any information with us, please contact us.
</p><p>
