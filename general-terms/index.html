                        <h3>IMPORTANT NOTICES</h3>
                        <p>OTC trading means that trading does not take place on a regulated exchange. There are no guarantees as to the credit worthiness of the counter party of your Forex, CFDs, Options and Spread Betting position. Also, there may be certain cases in which trading liquidity decreases, causing Forex, CFDs, Options and Spread Betting in commodities, currencies, metals and indices to cease, thereby preventing the liquidation of an adverse position which may result in a substantial financial loss.</p>

The market recommendations, signals, information provided by and/or distributed by AceFxPro are general in nature and based solely on the judgment of AceFxPro’s personnel or from third party information providers.

<p>Customer understands that AceFxPro does not permit its Customer representatives to either exercise discretion or manage an OTC account. If Customer’s account is not being traded with Customer’s authorisation, Customer must notify AceFxPro immediately.</p>

<p>AceFxPro’s margin policies and/or the policies of those banks/clearing houses through which trades are executed may require that additional funds be provided to properly margin Customer’s account and Customer is obligated to immediately meet such margin requirements. Failure to meet margin calls may result in the liquidation of any open positions with a resultant loss. AceFxPro reserves the right to refuse to accept any order.</p>

<p>Customer understands that it must carefully review the reports relating to Customer’s trading posted online by AceFxPro. All reports of execution and statements of accounts will be deemed final unless customer objects within two business days of being posted.

The Customer agrees that Customer is fully responsible for making all decisions as to transactions effected for Customer’s account.

    <li>(ii) Any act or omission by any person obtaining access to Customer's account, whether or not Customer has authorized such access or not,</li>
    <li>(iii) System malfunction, equipment failure (whether Customer's equipment or AceFxPro’s
equipment), system interruption or system unavailability, (iv) Delays, failure or errors in implementing any instruction,</li>
    <li>(v) Inaccurate or incomplete instructions received by AceFxPro’s from Customer, or</li>

</ul>










<p>
20.4 AceFxPro shall be entitled to setoff Customer's liabilities under this section from Customer's account.
</p>
<h3><strong>21. MARKET ABUSE AND MANIPULATION,</strong></h3>
<p>
21.1 PROHIBITION ON ARBITRAGE AND MANIPULATION
</p><p>
21.1.1 AceFxPro does not permit the practice of arbitrage when trading and strictly forbids any form of manipulation of its prices, execution, and platform or making transactions based on errors, omissions or misquotes on the AceFxPro platform.
</p><p>
21.1.2 Price latency, connectivity delays, and price feed errors sometimes create a situation where the prices displayed do not accurately reflect market rates. The concept of arbitrage and "scalping", or taking advantage of these Internet delays, cannot exist in an OTC market where the client is buying or selling directly from the market maker.
</p><p>
21.1.3 Any transactions that rely on price latency or price feed errors may be subject to intervention which includes the right to void any transactions which AceFxPro has determined to be a result of any of these practices, revocation of profits, widening of spreads, block of trading and any other necessary corrections or adjustments on the account without prior notice. 
</p><p>
21.1.4 If AceFxPro suspects or has reason to believe that Customer has abused the terms and conditions by hedging positions internally (using other trading accounts held with AceFxPro) or externally (using other trading accounts held with other brokers), AceFxPro reserves the right to cancel any trades or profits associated with Customer’s account(s).
</p><p>
21.2 MARKET ABUSE
</p><p>
21.2.1 AceFxPro may hedge our liability to you by opening analogous positions with other institutions or in the underlying market. The result of our doing this is that when you trade with us your trades can, through our hedging, exert a distorting influence on the underlying market for that index, in addition to the impact that it may have on our own prices. This creates a possibility of market abuse.
</p><p>



21.2.2 Customer represents and warrants, and agrees that each such representation and warranty is deemed repeated each time Customer opens or closes a position that:
</p><p>
(a) Customer will not place and has not placed a trade with us relating to a particular index or any other CFD price if to do so would result in Customer, or others with whom Customer is acting in concert together, having an exposure to the price of the underlying financial instrument which can create a situation of market abuse.
</p><p>
This exposure can be equal to or exceeding the amount of a declarable interest in the relevant financial instrument. For this purpose, the level of a declarable interest will be the prevailing level at the material time, set by law or by the stock exchange(s) or other exchange upon which the underlying financial instrument is traded; and
</p><p>
(b) Customer will not place and has not placed a trade with us in connection with:</p>
<ul>
    <li>(i) a placing, issue, distribution or other analogous event;</li>
    <li>(ii) an offer, take over, merger or other analogous event; or</li>
    <li>(iii) any other corporate finance style activity, in which Customer is involved or otherwise interested; and</li>
</ul>
 



<p>
(c) Customer will not place or close a position and Customer will not place an order that contravenes any primary or secondary legislation or other law against insider dealing or market manipulation. Customer agrees that AceFxPro may proceed on the basis that when Customer opens or closes a position or places an order on a share price, Customer may be treated as dealing in securities within the meaning of the relevant statutes or regulations.
</p> 
<p>
21.2.3 In the event that (a) Customer places or closes any trade or places an order in breach of the representations and warranties given, or AceFxPro has reasonable grounds for suspecting that Customer may have done so, AceFxPro may at our absolute discretion and without being under any obligation to inform Customer of our reason for doing so close that trade and any other trade or trades that you may have open at the time, if applicable, and also at our absolute discretion cancel any trades or profits associated with Customer’s account(s)
</p> 
<p>
21.2.4 Customer acknowledges that trade are speculative arrangements and Customer agrees that Customer will not enter into any transactions with us in connection with any corporate finance style activity.
</p> 
<p>
21.2.5 Customer acknowledges that it would be improper for Customer to deal in the underlying market if the sole purpose of such a transaction was to impact on our bid or offer prices, and Customer agrees not to conduct any such transactions.
</p> 
<p>
<h3><strong>22. EXECUTION OF ORDERS, STOP AND LIMITS</strong></h3>
 
<p>
22.1 AceFxPro will use commercially reasonable efforts to complete all orders which it may, in its sole discretion, choose to accept in accordance with the oral or written or computer instructions of Customer.
</p> 
<p>
22.2 AceFxPro reserves the right to refuse to accept any order.
</p> 
<p>
22.3 AceFxPro may, at its sole discretion, allow Customer to specify a closing price for a transaction at the trading platform through a “Close at Loss” and “Close at Profit” order, subject always to the terms of this Agreement and any other terms and conditions AceFxPro may implement from time to time.
</p> 
<p>
22.3.1 “Close at Loss” means an offer to close a transaction at a price determined in advance by Customer which, in the case of a transaction that is opened by offering to buy a specific number of a certain instrument, is lower than the opening transaction price, and in the case of a transaction that is opened by offering to sell a specific number of a certain instrument, is higher than the opening transaction price.
</p> 
<p>
22.3.2 “Close at Profit” means an offer to close a transaction at a price determined in advance by Customer which, in the case of a transaction that is opened by offering to buy a specific number of a certain instrument, is higher than the opening transaction price, and in the case of a transaction that is opened by offering to sell a specific number of a certain instrument, is lower than the opening transaction price. 
</p> 
<p>
22.4 Upon Customer's offer and AceFxPro's acceptance of an order, Customer hereby authorizes AceFxPro to close the transaction at the Close at Loss price or Close at Profit price, as applicable, and as agreed upon in the order, without further instruction from or notification to Customer.
</p> 
<p>
22.5 AceFxPro may, in its sole discretion, close the transaction when the price quoted by AceFxPro on the trading platform equals the price accepted by AceFxPro for such an order.
</p> 
<p>
22.6 Customer acknowledges and agrees that AceFxPro shall not be obligated to close a transaction which does not otherwise comply with any other limitations agreed upon with respect to such transaction.
</p> 
<p>
22.7 Customer acknowledges and agrees that due to market volatility and factors beyond AceFxPro's control, AceFxPro cannot guarantee that a Close at Loss order will be executed at the level specified in Customer's order. In such an event, AceFxPro will close the transaction at the next best price.
</p> 
<p>





22.8 If, before Customer's “Limit Order” offer to open or close a transaction is accepted by AceFxPro, AceFxPro's quote moves to Customer's advantage (for example, if the price goes down as Customer buys or the price goes up as Customer sells) Customer agrees that AceFxPro will execute the closing transaction at the Customer’s specified price and not better. Customer agrees that AceFxPro can retain such price movement for its own account.
</p> 
<p>
22.9 Customer is aware that a part of AceFxPro's revenues derives from the spreads on each transaction. The spread is the difference between the bid & the ask price of the price quote on a transaction. Therefore, in case the fair market price reduces AceFxPro’s spread in a specific transaction, AceFxPro may, at its sole discretion, choose not to execute such transaction, in which case AceFxPro may send Customer an amended quote for his consideration. AceFxPro may complete a transaction at its sole discretion in case the fair market price does not affect AceFxPro's spread from the transaction and / or increases it.
</p> 

<h3><strong>23. RISK ACKNOWLEDGMENT</strong></h3>
<p>
23.1 Customer acknowledges that investment in leveraged and non-leveraged transactions are speculative, involves a high degree of risk, and is appropriate only for persons who can assume risk of loss of their entire margin deposit.
</p> 
<p>
23.2 Customer understands that because of the low margin normally required in OTC trading, price changes in OTC may result in significant losses.
</p> 
<p>
23.3 Customer warrants that Customer is willing and able, financially and otherwise, to assume the risk of OTC trading, and in consideration of AceFxPro’s carrying his/her account(s), Customer agrees not to hold AceFxPro and any of its subsidiaries, affiliates or agents responsible for any losses incurred by Customer. 
</p> 
<p>
23.4 Customer recognizes that guarantees of profit or freedom from loss are impossible in OTC trading.
</p> 
<p>
23.5 Customer acknowledges that Customer has received no such guarantees from AceFxPro or from any of its representatives or any introducing agent or other entity with whom Customer is conducting his/her AceFxPro account and has not entered into this agreement in consideration of or in reliance upon any such guarantees or similar representations.
</p> 
<p>
23.6 The high degree of leverage that is obtainable in the trading of Forex, CFDs, Options and Spread Betting transactions can work against you as well as for you. Leverage can lead to large losses as well as gains.
</p> 
<p>
23.7 During times of extreme volatility it can be difficult or impossible to execute orders.
</p>

    <ul>
        <li>
(i) Any market recommendations, signals and information communicated by any method of communication to Customer by AceFxPro and any of its subsidiaries, affiliates, agents or by any person within AceFxPro does not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy any OTC contract, and that AceFxPro does not provide investment advice
</li>
        <li>
(ii) Such recommendation and information, although generally based upon information obtained from sources believed by AceFxPro to be reliable, may be based solely on a broker’s opinion and that such information may be incomplete and may be unverified, and

associate, stockholder or representative may not be consistent with the recommendations furnished to Customer by AceFxPro.
</p>

</p>

<h3><strong>40. WITHDRAWAL AND DEPOSIT PROCEDURES</strong></h3>
<p>
40.1 Customer further acknowledges and accepts AceFxPro’s procedures with respect to withdrawals and deposits to accounts as set forth below:

    <li>(ii) Customer acknowledges that withdrawals may take longer than expected for numerous
reasons, some in AceFxPro’s control and some not.</li>
    <li>(iii) Credit card deposits may be, according to credit card companies' regulations, returned to the same credit card when a withdrawal is performed. A withdrawal to a bank account where initial deposits have been performed by credit cards will be executed back to credit card or to the bank account at AceFxPro's discretion. Withdrawals to bank account may take a longer time period, due to additional security procedures.</li>
    <li>(iv) Credit Card Deposits Variance: When choosing an account base currency other than USD, Customer's credit card may be debited sums which due to exchange rates and credit card companies’ fees, may slightly vary from the initial sum that has been deposited by Customer in the account base currency. Customer hereby accepts that such variations may occur and hereby affirms that Customer shall not seek to object or charge this back.</li>
    <li>(v) When depositing by a Bank Transfer, as required by anti-money-laundering regulations, Customer is required to use a bank account, which is in Customer's country of residence and in Customer's name. Any withdrawal of funds, from Customer's AceFxPro account to a bank account, can only be refunded to the same bank account that the funds were originally received from.</li>
    <li>(vi) Alternative payment methods (internet payment vendors; money transfer services; etc.): when depositing funds using a facility other than credit cards and/or banks, you agree to, and acknowledge being bound by, the regulations and rules of such service, including, but not limited to, fees and other restrictions. AceFxPro, at its sole discretion, may execute withdrawals to a facility other than the facility used for the original deposit, in accordance with anti-money-laundering regulations.</li>
